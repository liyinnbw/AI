# A Neural Net Approach to Optical Character Recognition

## Problem Definition:
Inspired by [this toy problem](https://www.dlology.com/blog/how-to-train-a-keras-model-to-recognize-variable-length-text) and make it more difficult as:
Input: a sequence of sub-images extracted from a text image
Output: decoded sentence in text

We'll use [GRID corpus]() to generate training data.
